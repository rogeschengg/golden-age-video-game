# golden-age-video-game

Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critics and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.

This project uses techniques such as joining data in SQL, including left and inner joins, set theory concepts such as union and intercept, and subqueries.
Additionally, the project requires selecting columns from a table, filtering rows where they meet a criterion, using aggregation functions, performing calculations on groups of rows, and filtering grouped data.
